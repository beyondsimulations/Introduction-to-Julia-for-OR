# Introduction to Multi-threading in Julia
# =====================================================

# This Julia script is an interactive tutorial to introduce you to multi-threading in Julia.
# You'll learn about the basics of threading, how to create and manage threads, and best practices for writing thread-safe code.
# Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and confirm your understanding with examples and @assert statements.

# ---------------------------
# Section 73: Understanding Threads in Julia
# ---------------------------
println("Section 73: Understanding Threads in Julia")

# Julia allows efficient multi-threading by sharing memory and data structures between threads.

# Check the number of threads (set by JULIA_NUM_THREADS environment variable)
thread_count = Threads.nthreads()
println("Number of threads: ", thread_count)

# Assert that the expected number of threads are available
# Replace 'expected_thread_count' with the actual expected number
expected_thread_count = 4  # Example value
@assert thread_count == expected_thread_count

# ---------------------------
# Section 74: Creating Threads
# ---------------------------
println("Section 74: Creating Threads")

# Julia provides the @threads macro to easily distribute work across multiple threads.

# Example: Use multi-threading to perform a simple computation
n = 100
results = zeros(n)
Threads.@threads for i in 1:n
    results[i] = i^2
end

# Assert that the computation is correct
@assert results == [i^2 for i in 1:n]

println("Threads created and computation performed successfully!")

# Section 75: Managing Data and State in Threads
# ---------------------------
println("Section 75: Managing Data and State in Threads")

# Managing data and state in a multi-threaded environment can be challenging due to potential race conditions and data corruption.

# Discuss and demonstrate how to safely manage data and state in threads, such as using atomic operations or thread-safe data structures.

# ---------------------------
# Section 76: Best Practices for Multi-threading
# ---------------------------
println("Section 76: Best Practices for Multi-threading")

# Discuss best practices for multi-threading, such as:
# - Avoiding race conditions
# - Minimizing data transfer between threads
# - Balancing workload among threads
# - Using appropriate synchronization mechanisms (locks, atomics, etc.)

# Conclusion
