# Error Handling and Debugging in Julia
# =====================================================

# This Julia script is an interactive tutorial to introduce you to error handling and debugging in Julia.
# You'll learn about common error types, how to handle errors gracefully, and use Julia's debugging tools.
# Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and confirm your understanding with examples.

# ---------------------------
# Section 53: Understanding Common Errors
# ---------------------------
println("Section 53: Understanding Common Errors")

# Understanding common error types in Julia (syntax errors, runtime errors, logical errors) and how to identify them.

# Exercise 53.1: Discuss and provide examples of common errors.

# ---------------------------
# Section 54: Graceful Error Handling
# ---------------------------
println("Section 54: Graceful Error Handling")

# Error handling using try-catch blocks allows your program to continue running or fail gracefully when an error occurs.

# Exercise 54.1: Implement a try-catch block
error_caught = false
try
    # Intentionally generate an error (e.g., division by zero)
    error_result = 1 / 0
catch e
    println("Caught an error: ", e)
    error_caught = true
end

# Assert that the error was caught
@assert error_caught == true

# ---------------------------
# Section 55: Using Julia's Debugging Tools
# ---------------------------
println("Section 55: Using Julia's Debugging Tools")

# Introduce Julia's built-in debugging tools (e.g., @debug, @info, @warn, @error) and how to use them effectively.

# Exercise 55.1: Use debugging macros to provide information, warnings, or errors.
@info "This is an informational message."
@warn "This is a warning message."
@error "This is an error message."

# Exercise 55.2: Introduce and demonstrate the use of the Debugger.jl package for step-by-step debugging.

# ---------------------------
# Section 56: Best Practices for Writing Robust Code
# ---------------------------
println("Section 56: Best Practices for Writing Robust Code")

# Discuss best practices for writing robust and error-resistant code in Julia. This might include:
# - Writing small, focused functions
# - Using assert statements to check conditions
# - Writing tests for your code
# - Thoroughly commenting and documenting code
# - Regularly using version control
