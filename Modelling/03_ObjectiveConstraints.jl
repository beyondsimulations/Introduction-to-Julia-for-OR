#= This Julia script is an interactive tutorial to introduce you to advanced 
handling of objective functions and constraints in JuMP. You'll learn about defining 
and managing objective functions and constraints within containers (arrays, 
dictionaries, matrices), and how to implement conditional constraints effectively.
Follow the instructions, write your code in the designated code blocks, and confirm 
your understanding with @assert statements. Make sure to have the JuMP package 
installed to follow this tutorial. =#

using JuMP, HiGHS

# Again, we need a model first to assign something to it.
another_model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)

## Section 1: Objective Functions with Container Variables
# ---------------------------
println("Section 1: Objective Functions with Container Variables")

#= Defining objective functions with variables in containers allows for scalable and 
dynamic model formulations. First, we need a container with variables for the 
objective function. For example:

@variable(modelName, variableName[1:3] >= 0)
Now, we can define an objective function with the container. For example:

@objective(modelName, Max, sum(variableName[i] for i in 1:3)) =#

## Exercise 1.1: 
#= Define an array of variables and an objective function for 'another_model'. The 
variables should be called 'profit' and have a range from 1:8. It has an upper 
bound of 12. The objective should be a Maximization of the sum of all 'profits'. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW


# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert length(profits) == 8 && all(lower_bound(profits[i]) == 0 for i in 1:8)
@assert typeof(objective_function(another_model)) == AffExpr
println("Objective function with container variables defined successfully!")

# Section 2: Constraints within Containers
# ---------------------------
println("Section 2: Constraints within Containers")

#= Defining constraints within containers allows for structured and easilymanageable 
models. This is especially important when models become larger! To define a 
constraint within a container, we can do, for example, the following:

@constraint(modelName, constraintName[i in 1:3], variableName[i] <= 100)

This would create a constraint called constraintName for each i - thus 1,2, and 3 - 
where variableName[1], variableName[2], and variableName[3] are restricted to be 
maximally 100. =#

## Exercise 2.1: 
#= Define constraints called 'maxProfit' using an array of variables. The logic: 
Each profit defined in the previous task should be less than or equal to 12. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW


# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert all(is_valid(another_model, maxProfit[i]) for i in 1:8)
println("Constraints within containers defined successfully!")

# Section 3: Implementing Conditional Constraints
# ---------------------------
println("Section 3: Implementing Conditional Constraints")

#= Conditional constraints are added to the model based on certain conditions, 
allowing for dynamic and flexible model formulations. To define a constraint within  
a container under conditions, we can do the following:
 
@constraint(modelName, constraintName[i in 1:3; i <= 2], variableName[i] <= 50)

This would create a constraint called constraintName for each i - thus 1,2, and 3 - 
where variableName[1], variableName[2] are restricted to be maximally 50 and 
variableName[3] was not restricted. =#

# Exercise 3.1: 
#= Add a conditional constraint 'smallProfit' to the previous model. Condition: Only 
the first 4 variables profit have to be lower than 5. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW


# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert all(is_valid(another_model, smallProfit[i]) for i in 1:4)
println("Conditional constraint implemented successfully!")
println("Checking successful implementation.")
optimize!(another_model)
status = termination_status(another_model)
@assert status == MOI.OPTIMAL "Sorry, something didn't work out as the model status is $status"
@assert objective_value(another_model) â‰ˆ 68 atol=1e-4 "Although you have an optimal solution, 
    the should be 68 not $(objective_value(another_model)). Is the model correct?"
println("Model components validated successfully!")
