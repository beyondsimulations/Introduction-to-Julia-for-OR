# In-Depth Exploration of Variable Scopes in Julia
# ================================================

# This interactive Julia script is a deep dive into the nuances of variable scopes in Julia.
# Grasp the intricacies of local and global scopes, comprehend the significance of 'local' and 'global' keywords, 
# and discern the scope behaviors in different contexts.
# Follow the structured instructions, implement your code in the designated blocks, and affirm your comprehension with @assert statements.

## Section 1: The Local and Global Scope
# -------------------------------------
println("Section 1: The Local and Global Scope")

# In Julia, variables within a function or a loop are encapsulated in a local scope, 
# meaning their visibility and lifespan are confined to that block of code.
# Variables declared in the main body of a script are in the global scope, making them accessible 
# and modifiable across your entire program.

## Exercise 1.1: Experiment with Local Variables in a Loop
# Try to execude the following block of code:
println("Defining a local variable within a loop:")
for i in 1:3
    loop_variable = i
    println("Inside the loop, loop_variable is: ", loop_variable)
end
println("Outside the loop, loop_variable is: ", loop_variable)

# Note: Attempting to access loop_variable here should result in an error because its scope is local to the loop.
# Can you come up with a way to solve this issue? Extend the code above to allow the execution of the code.

# Test your answer
@assert loop_variable == 3
println("Now, the loop works and the value of the 'loop_variable' is: ", loop_variable)

## Exercise 1.2: Experiment with Local Variables in a Nested Loop
# Try to execude the following block of code:
println("Defining a local variable within a loop:")
for i in 1:3
    nestedloop_variable = 0
    for j in 1:3
        nestedloop_variable = i * 3
        println("Inside the nested loop, loop_variable is: ", nestedloop_variable)
    end
end
println("Outside the nested loop, loop_variable is: ", nestedloop_variable)

# Note: Attempting to access nestedloop_variable here should result in an error because its scope is only accessible
# in the first loop, where it is defined, and the second loop below.
# Can you come up with a way to solve this issue? Extend the code above to allow the execution of the code.

# Test your answer
@assert nestedloop_variable == 9
println("Now, the loop works and the value of the 'nestedloop_variable' is: ", loop_variable)

## Section 2: Working with `global` and `local` Keywords
# ---------------------------------------------------
println("Section 3: Working with `global` and `local` Keywords")

# Use 'global' to designate a global variable inside a local scope. 
# Conversely, 'local' explicitly defines a local variable, particularly in contexts where global inference might occur.

## Exercise 2.1: Experiment with Local Variables  in a Potentially Global Context Using `local`
# Try to execude the following block of code. The objective is to redefine the 'explicit_local_variable' to "end"
# within the following loop.

explicit_local_variable = "start"
println("At the start of the loop, explicit_local_variable is: ", explicit_local_variable)
for i in 1:3
    local explicit_local_variable = "end"
    println("Inside the loop, explicit_local_variable is: ", explicit_local_variable)
end
println("Outside the loop, explicit_local_variable is: ", explicit_local_variable)

# Note: Without any changes, explicit_local_variable is local to the loop, hence not changed outside.
# Can you come up with a way to change it inside the loop? Do so by changing the code above in the loop.

# Test your answer
@assert explicit_local_variable == "end" "Currently, the value of 'explicit_local_variable' is $explicit_local_variable."
