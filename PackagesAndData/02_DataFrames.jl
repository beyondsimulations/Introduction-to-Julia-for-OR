#= This interactive Julia script is your comprehensive guide to understanding 
DataFrames in Julia. Work on creating DataFrames, accessing, modifying, and 
filtering data, alongside basic data manipulation techniques. Follow the 
instructions, input your code in the designated areas, and verify your 
implementations with @assert statements. Note: Ensure you have the DataFrames 
package installed to effectively follow this tutorial! =#

using DataFrames

## Section 1: Creating DataFrames
# -------------------------------
println("Section 1: Creating DataFrames")

#= A DataFrame in Julia is akin to a table in SQL or a spreadsheet - each column can 
have its own type, making it highly versatile. A DataFrame can be created using the 
DataFrame constructor and passing key-value pairs where the key is the column name 
and the value is an array of data. For more help, use '?' in the REPL and type 
'DataFrame'. =#

## Exercise 1.1: 
#= Create and Test a DataFrame. Create a DataFrame named 'employees' with the 
columns 'Name', 'Age', and 'Salary', and populate it with the specified data:
John is 28 years old and earns 50000, Mike is 23 years old and earns 62000. Frank is 
37 years old and earns 90000. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW
employees = DataFrame(Name = ["John", "Mike", "Frank"], Age = [28, 23, 37], Salary = [50000, 62000, 90000])

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert employees == DataFrame(Name = ["John", "Mike", "Frank"], 
    Age = [28, 23, 37], Salary = [50000, 62000, 90000])
println("DataFrame created successfully!")
println(employees)

## Section 2: Accessing and Modifying Data
# ----------------------------------------
println("Section 2: Accessing and Modifying Data")

#= Accessing columns in a DataFrame can be done using the dot syntax, while rows can 
be accessed via indexing. Modification of data is straightforward; just assign a new 
value to the desired cell. To access the column 'name' in our DataFrame with 
employees, we could do: 
employees.Name 
To access the third name specifically, we could do: 
employees.Name[3] =#

## Exercise 2.1: 
# Access the 'Age' column from the DataFrame and save it in a new variable 'ages.

# YOUR CODE BELOW
ages = employees.Age
println("Ages column: ", ages)

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert ages == [28, 23, 37]
println("Correct, the Ages column is: ", ages)

## Exercise 2.2:
# Update John's salary to 59000.

# YOUR CODE BELOW
employees.Salary[1] = 59000

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert employees.Salary[1] == 59000
println("Modified DataFrame: ")
println(employees)

## Section 3: Filtering Data
# --------------------------
println("Section 3: Filtering Data")

#= Logical indexing can be used to filter rows in a DataFrame based on conditions. 
To filter the DataFrame to include only employees names "Frank" we could do:
allFranks = employees[employees.Name .== "Frank", :]
Alternatively, the filter function provides a powerful tool to extract subsets of 
data based on a condition:
allFranks = filter(row -> row.Name == "Frank", employees) =#

## Exercise 3.1: 
#= Filter the DataFrame to include only employees with salaries above 60000. Save 
the resulting employees in the DataFrame 'high_earners'. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW
high_earners = employees[employees.Salary .> 60000, :]

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert nrow(high_earners) == 2
println("High earners: ")
println(high_earners)

## Section 4: Basic Data Manipulation
# -----------------------------------
println("Section 4: Basic Data Manipulation")

#= Julia provides functions for basic data manipulation tasks, including sorting, 
grouping, and joining DataFrames. The 'sort' function can be used to order the rows 
in a DataFrame based on the values in one or more columns. To see how to use the 
function, type '?' into the REPL (terminal) and type 'sort'. =#

## Exercise 4.1: 
# Sort the DataFrame based on the 'Age' column and save it as 'sorted_df'.

# YOUR CODE BELOW
sorted_df = sort(employees, :Age)

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert sorted_df.Age[1] == 23
println("DataFrame sorted by age: ")
println(sorted_df)

#= Hint: If you have more complicated data structures, take a look at JSON files 
which can be used to work with all kind of differently structured data sets. =#
