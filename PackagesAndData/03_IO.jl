#= This interactive Julia script introduces the essentials of interacting with 
external files. It covers reading and writing text files, handling CSV, and working 
with delimited files using DelimitedFiles. Follow the instructions, write your code 
in the designated code blocks, and validate your results with @assert statements. =#

## Section 1: Working with Delimited Files
# ---------------------------
println("Section 1: Working with Delimited Files")

#= Delimited files, such as .csv or .tsv, can be handled efficiently using the 
DelimitedFiles package in Julia. This requires the DelimitedFiles package. But as it 
is part of the Julia Standard Library, you can use it directly without the need to 
use Pkg.add() before. =#

using DelimitedFiles

# The following code writes a matrix to a CSV file, seperating values with ','.
new_data = [10 12 6; 13 25 1; 40 30 7]
open("ExampleData/matrix.csv", "w") do io
    writedlm(io, new_data, ',')
end
println("CSV file 'matrix.csv' written successfully to folder ExampleData!")

## Exercise 1.1: 
#= Read the just written CSV file 'matrix.csv' using the function readdlm(). Save 
the matrix in the variable 'read_matrix". To learn the syntax, use the inbuild help 
by typing '?' int the terminal. Afterwards, just typethe function nam for an 
explanation. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW
read_matrix = readdlm("ExampleData/matrix.csv", ',')

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert read_matrix == new_data
println("File 'matrix.csv' read successfully!")

## Section 2: Working with CSV Files and DataFrames
# --------------------------------------------------
println("Section 2: Working with CSV Files and DataFrames")

#= The CSV package in Julia provides powerful tools for reading and writing CSV 
files to and from DataFrames, a common requirement in data analysis and data 
science projects. This requires the CSV and DataFrames packages. If you solely 
followed the course so far, you first have to install the CSV Package before 
you can start using it: import Pkg; Pkg.add("CSV) =#

using CSV, DataFrames

## Exercise 2.1: 
#= Write the following given DataFrame to a CSV file 'table_out.csv' in the folder 
'ExampleData'. This can be done by using the function CSV.write(). To learn the 
syntax, ask the inbuild help with '?' and the function name. =#
data = DataFrame(Name = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], Age = [25, 30, 35])
csv_file_path = "ExampleData/table_out.csv"

# YOUR CODE BELOW
CSV.write(csv_file_path, data)

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your answer
@assert isfile("ExampleData/table_out.csv") "Sorry, the file could not be found. 
    Have you followed all steps?"
println("CSV file 'data.csv' written successfully!")

## Exercise 2.2: 
#= Read the CSV file 'table_in.csv' in the folder 'ExampleData' into the variable 
'read_data'. Here you can use the function CSV.read(). Again, use the inbuild help 
to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Note, that you need to provide a sink for 
the data wehen using CSV.read(), e.g. a DataFrame. =#

# YOUR CODE BELOW
read_data = CSV.read("ExampleData/table_in.csv", DataFrame)

# YOUR CODE ABOVE
# Test your CSV reading
@assert read_data[1,1] == "Lisa"
println("CSV file 'table_in.csv' read successfully!")

## Conclusion
# ---------------------------
println()
println("Congratulations! You've successfully completed the tutorial on reading and")
println("writing external files in Julia. Continue to the next file to learn more.")
