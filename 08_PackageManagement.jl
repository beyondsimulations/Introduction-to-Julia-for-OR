# =====================================================
# Introduction to Packages and Package Management in Julia
# =====================================================

# This Julia script is an interactive tutorial to introduce you to packages and package management in Julia.
# You'll learn about using the package manager, adding, updating, and removing packages, and managing environments.
# Note: This script will guide you, but package management commands need to be run in Julia's REPL or a Jupyter notebook.

# ---------------------------
# Section 21: Using the Package Manager
# ---------------------------
println("Section 21: Using the Package Manager")

# The package manager in Julia is accessed through the Pkg module. To start using Pkg, you need to import it.

# Exercise 21.1: Import the Pkg module
import Pkg

println("Pkg module imported successfully!")

# ---------------------------
# Section 22: Adding Packages
# ---------------------------
println("Section 22: Adding Packages")

# To add a package in Julia, you use the Pkg.add() function with the package name.

# Exercise 22.1: Add the Example package (Note: This is just a placeholder, replace 'Example' with a real package for actual use)
# Pkg.add("Example")

println("Package added successfully! (Note: Run the actual command in REPL or a Jupyter notebook)")

# ---------------------------
# Section 23: Updating and Removing Packages
# ---------------------------
println("Section 23: Updating and Removing Packages")

# You can update packages using Pkg.update(). To remove a package, use Pkg.rm().

# Exercise 23.1: Update all installed packages (Note: This is just a placeholder, run the actual command in REPL)
# Pkg.update()

# Exercise 23.2: Remove the Example package (Note: This is just a placeholder, replace 'Example' with a real package for actual use)
# Pkg.rm("Example")

println("Packages updated and removed successfully! (Note: Run the actual commands in REPL or a Jupyter notebook)")

# ---------------------------
# Section 24: Managing Environments
# ---------------------------
println("Section 24: Managing Environments")

# Julia environments allow you to manage dependencies for your projects separately. Each environment can have its own set of packages.

# Exercise 24.1: Create a new environment (Note: This is just a placeholder, run the actual command in REPL)
# Pkg.activate("new_environment")
# Pkg.add("Example")

println("Environment managed successfully! (Note: Run the actual commands in REPL or a Jupyter notebook)")

# ---------------------------
# Conclusion
# ---------------------------
println("Great job! You've completed the tutorial on packages and package management in Julia.")
println("You've learned how to use the package manager to add, update, and remove packages, and how to manage environments.")
println("These skills are crucial for efficiently managing and using external libraries and tools in your Julia projects.")
